# influxdb-on-raspberry
[Influxdb](http://influxdb.com) *unofficial* packages for arm based raspberry pi.

Influxdb doesn't provide packages for arm, so these packages are here
to allow easy install.

Packages were build on a raspberry pi 2 running raspbian (2015-05-05) from the Influxdb
[source](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb). Each directory contains a README.md
file that discribes how packages were build and so, how you can do it yourself
if you are not confortable with unofficial packages.
